            Social media has eliminated the need for everyone who wants to share their thoughts online to have a blog, but there are still plenty of excellent reasons for blogging. A blog lets you showcase your work, promote your business, and drive business through content marketing.

Whatever the reason you want to set up a blog, there are dozens of blog sites out there—including many WordPress alternatives—to host your content. Here we'll give our picks for the best blogging platforms for a variety of use cases.

What Makes a Great Blogging Platform?
Blogs have been around since the earliest days of the internet—people have always wanted a place to share their thoughts, opinions, and knowledge with the wider world. The platforms, however, are always evolving. Once great blogging solutions, like LiveJournal, are now dated wastelands caught in 2003. Things look very different today.

When looking for the best blogging websites, we first wanted to be sure that they were actual blogging platforms. There's a very thin line between blogging software and content management systems (CMS). In fact, they overlap: You can use a CMS like Drupal to make a blog, and WordPress, while thought of as a blogging platform, definitely doubles as a CMS. Our guiding principle was that it had to be easy to set up a simple blog like "Harry's Needlepoint Patterns" or "Moustaches I've Met and Loved"—without jumping through hoops. It also had to be easy to do blog-y things, like add new posts, share them individually, and accept comments. While you can do all these things with a CMS, it requires a lot more effort to get started.

A big part of the blogging experience is customizing your site so you don't look like everyone else out there. The best blogging platforms have a wide range of themes and customization options. Of course, people writing blogs—like us—often aren't super technical. So when reviewing blogging sites, we only considered options that had good support documentation or other resources people could use if things got tough. For example, setting up WordPress on your own hosted server can be tricky and technical, but there are a lot of resources and services out there that allow for anyone to do it.

The internet once promised to make all information free—and blogs were a big part of that. We didn't require our selected blogging platforms to be totally free of charge, but we did need them to be affordable. A few dollars a month was fine—or a bit more if it was business-focused—but nothing ridiculous. And finally, we required that the platforms were under active development and reasonably popular. While there are some interesting small, independent options out there, we aren't confident they'll exist forever. While a service is, of course, never guaranteed to stay online, we wanted some kind of proven track record and ongoing development.
